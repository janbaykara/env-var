## 2.4.0 (15 December 2016)
* Add `asArray([delimeter])` to read environment variables as an array by splitting
the varible string on each instance of _delimeter_;
* Add `asJsonArray()` to read in an environment variable that contains a JSON
Array. Similar to `asJson()`, but ensures the variable is an Array.

Object. Similar to `asJson()`, but ensures the variable is an Object.
